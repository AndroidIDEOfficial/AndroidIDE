/**
 * XMLString is a structure used to pass character arrays. However,
 * XMLStringBuffer is a buffer in which characters can be appended
 * and extends XMLString so that it can be passed to methods
 * expecting an XMLString object. This is a safe operation because
 * it is assumed that any callee will <strong>not</strong> modify
 * the contents of the XMLString structure.
 * <p>
 * The contents of the string are managed by the string buffer. As
 * characters are appended, the string buffer will grow as needed.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> Never set the <code>ch</code>,
 * <code>offset</code>, and <code>length</code> fields directly.
 * These fields are managed by the string buffer. In order to reset
 * the buffer, call <code>clear()</code>.
