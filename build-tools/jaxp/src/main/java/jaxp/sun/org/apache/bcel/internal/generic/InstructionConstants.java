/**
 * This interface contains shareable instruction objects.
 *
 * In order to save memory you can use some instructions multiply,
 * since they have an immutable state and are directly derived from
 * Instruction.  I.e. they have no instance fields that could be
 * changed. Since some of these instructions like ICONST_0 occur
 * very frequently this can save a lot of time and space. This
 * feature is an adaptation of the FlyWeight design pattern, we
 * just use an array instead of a factory.
 *
 * The Instructions can also accessed directly under their names, so
 * it's possible to write il.append(Instruction.ICONST_0);
