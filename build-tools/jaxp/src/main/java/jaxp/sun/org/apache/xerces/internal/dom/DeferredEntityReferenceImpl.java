/**
 * EntityReference models the XML &entityname; syntax, when used for
 * entities defined by the DOM. Entities hardcoded into XML, such as
 * character entities, should instead have been translated into text
 * by the code which generated the DOM tree.
 * <P>
 * An XML processor has the alternative of fully expanding Entities
 * into the normal document tree. If it does so, no EntityReference nodes
 * will appear.
 * <P>
 * Similarly, non-validating XML processors are not required to read
 * or process entity declarations made in the external subset or
 * declared in external parameter entities. Hence, some applications
 * may not make the replacement value available for Parsed Entities
 * of these types.
 * <P>
 * EntityReference behaves as a read-only node, and the children of
 * the EntityReference (which reflect those of the Entity, and should
 * also be read-only) give its replacement value, if any. They are
 * supposed to automagically stay in synch if the DocumentType is
 * updated with new values for the Entity.
 * <P>
 * The defined behavior makes efficient storage difficult for the DOM
 * implementor. We can't just look aside to the Entity's definition
 * in the DocumentType since those nodes have the wrong parent (unless
 * we can come up with a clever "imaginary parent" mechanism). We
 * must at least appear to clone those children... which raises the
 * issue of keeping the reference synchronized with its parent.
 * This leads me back to the "cached image of centrally defined data"
 * solution, much as I dislike it.
 * <P>
 * For now I have decided, since REC-DOM-Level-1-19980818 doesn't
 * cover this in much detail, that synchronization doesn't have to be
 * considered while the user is deep in the tree. That is, if you're
 * looking within one of the EntityReferennce's children and the Entity
 * changes, you won't be informed; instead, you will continue to access
 * the same object -- which may or may not still be part of the tree.
 * This is the same behavior that obtains elsewhere in the DOM if the
 * subtree you're looking at is deleted from its parent, so it's
 * acceptable here. (If it really bothers folks, we could set things
 * up so deleted subtrees are walked and marked invalid, but that's
 * not part of the DOM's defined behavior.)
 * <P>
 * As a result, only the EntityReference itself has to be aware of
 * changes in the Entity. And it can take advantage of the same
 * structure-change-monitoring code I implemented to support
 * DeepNodeList.
