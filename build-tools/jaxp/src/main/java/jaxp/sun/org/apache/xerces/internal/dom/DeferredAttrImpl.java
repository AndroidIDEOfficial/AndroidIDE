/**
 * Attribute represents an XML-style attribute of an
 * Element. Typically, the allowable values are controlled by its
 * declaration in the Document Type Definition (DTD) governing this
 * kind of document.
 * <P>
 * If the attribute has not been explicitly assigned a value, but has
 * been declared in the DTD, it will exist and have that default. Only
 * if neither the document nor the DTD specifies a value will the
 * Attribute really be considered absent and have no value; in that
 * case, querying the attribute will return null.
 * <P>
 * Attributes may have multiple children that contain their data. (XML
 * allows attributes to contain entity references, and tokenized
 * attribute types such as NMTOKENS may have a child for each token.)
 * For convenience, the Attribute object's getValue() method returns
 * the string version of the attribute's value.
 * <P>
 * Attributes are not children of the Elements they belong to, in the
 * usual sense, and have no valid Parent reference. However, the spec
 * says they _do_ belong to a specific Element, and an INUSE exception
 * is to be thrown if the user attempts to explicitly share them
 * between elements.
 * <P>
 * Note that Elements do not permit attributes to appear to be shared
 * (see the INUSE exception), so this object's mutability is
 * officially not an issue.
 * <P>
 * DeferredAttrImpl inherits from AttrImpl which does not support
 * Namespaces. DeferredAttrNSImpl, which inherits from AttrNSImpl, does.
