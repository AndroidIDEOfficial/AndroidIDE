/**
 * <p>Drop in replacement for the standard class loader of the JVM. You can use it
 * in conjunction with the JavaWrapper to dynamically modify/create classes
 * as they're requested.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class loader recognizes special requests in a distinct
 * format, i.e., when the name of the requested class contains with
 * "$$BCEL$$" it calls the createClass() method with that name
 * (everything bevor the $$BCEL$$ is considered to be the package
 * name. You can subclass the class loader and override that
 * method. "Normal" classes class can be modified by overriding the
 * modifyClass() method which is called just before defineClass().</p>
 *
 * <p>There may be a number of packages where you have to use the default
 * class loader (which may also be faster). You can define the set of packages
 * where to use the system class loader in the constructor. The default value contains
 * "java.", "sun.", "javax."</p>
