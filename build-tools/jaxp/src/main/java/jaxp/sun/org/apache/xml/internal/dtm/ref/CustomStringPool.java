/** <p>CustomStringPool is an example of appliction provided data structure
 * for a DTM implementation to hold symbol references, e.g. elelment names.
 * It will follow the DTMDStringPool interface and use two simple methods
 * indexToString(int i) and stringToIndex(Sring s) to map between a set of
 * string values and a set of integer index values.  Therefore, an application
 * may improve DTM processing speed by substituting the DTM symbol resolution
 * tables with application specific quick symbol resolution tables.</p>
 *
 * %REVIEW% The only difference between this an DTMStringPool seems to be that
 * it uses a java.lang.Hashtable full of Integers rather than implementing its
 * own hashing. Joe deliberately avoided that approach when writing
 * DTMStringPool, since it is both much more memory-hungry and probably slower
 * -- especially in JDK 1.1.x, where Hashtable is synchronized. We need to
 * either justify this implementation or discard it.
 *
 * <p>Status: In progress, under discussion.</p>
