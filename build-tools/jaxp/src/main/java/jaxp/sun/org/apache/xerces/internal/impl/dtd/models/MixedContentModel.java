 * MixedContentModel is a derivative of the abstract content model base

 * is mixed model, it has PCDATA as its first possible content, followed
 * by an alternation of the possible children. The children cannot have any
 * numeration or order, so it must look like this:
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;!ELEMENT Foo ((#PCDATA|a|b|c|)*)&gt;
 * </pre>
 * So, all we have to do is to keep an array of the possible children and
 * validate by just looking up each child being validated by looking it up
 * in the list.
