     AttributeReaders based on the name of the attributes it is
     constructing.

     @param name_index An index into the constant pool, indexing a
     ConstantUtf8 that represents the name of the attribute.

     @param length The length of the data contained in the attribute.  This
     is written into the constant pool and should agree with what the
     factory expects the length to be.

     @param file This is the data input stream that the factory needs to read
     its data from.

     @param constant_pool This is the constant pool associated with the
     Attribute that we are constructing.

     @return The user-defined AttributeReader should take this data and use
     it to construct an attribute.  In the case of errors, a null can be
     returned which will cause the parsing of the class file to fail.
