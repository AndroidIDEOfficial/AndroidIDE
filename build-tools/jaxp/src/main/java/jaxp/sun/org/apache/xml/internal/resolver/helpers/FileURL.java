   * Construct a file: URL for a path name.
   *
   * <p>URLs in the file: scheme can be constructed for paths on
   * the local file system. Several possibilities need to be considered:
   * </p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>If the path does not begin with a slash, then it is assumed
   * to reside in the users current working directory
   * (System.getProperty("user.dir")).</li>
   * <li>On Windows machines, the current working directory uses
   * backslashes (\\, instead of /).</li>
   * <li>If the current working directory is "/", don't add an extra
   * slash before the base name.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This method is declared static so that other classes
   * can use it directly.</p>
   *
   * @param pathname The path name component for which to construct a URL.
   *
   * @return The appropriate file: URL.
   *
   * @throws MalformedURLException if the pathname can't be turned into
   *         a proper URL.
