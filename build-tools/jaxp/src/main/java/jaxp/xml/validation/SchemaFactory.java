/**
 * Factory that creates {@link Schema} objects&#x2E; Entry-point to
 * the validation API.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link SchemaFactory} is a schema compiler. It reads external
 * representations of schemas and prepares them for validation.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link SchemaFactory} class is not thread-safe. In other words,
 * it is the application's responsibility to ensure that at most
 * one thread is using a {@link SchemaFactory} object at any
 * given moment. Implementations are encouraged to mark methods
 * as <code>synchronized</code> to protect themselves from broken clients.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link SchemaFactory} is not re-entrant. While one of the
 * <code>newSchema</code> methods is being invoked, applications
 * may not attempt to recursively invoke the <code>newSchema</code> method,
 * even from the same thread.
 *
 * <h2><a name="schemaLanguage"></a>Schema Language</h2>
 * <p>
 * This spec uses a namespace URI to designate a schema language.
 * The following table shows the values defined by this specification.
 * <p>
 * To be compliant with the spec, the implementation
 * is only required to support W3C XML Schema 1.0. However,
 * if it chooses to support other schema languages listed here,
 * it must conform to the relevant behaviors described in this spec.
 *
 * <p>
 * Schema languages not listed here are expected to
 * introduce their own URIs to represent themselves.
 * The {@link SchemaFactory} class is capable of locating other
 * implementations for other schema languages at run-time.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that because the XML DTD is strongly tied to the parsing process
 * and has a significant effect on the parsing process, it is impossible
 * to define the DTD validation as a process independent from parsing.
 * For this reason, this specification does not define the semantics for
 * the XML DTD. This doesn't prohibit implementors from implementing it
 * in a way they see fit, but <em>users are warned that any DTD
 * validation implemented on this interface necessarily deviate from
 * the XML DTD semantics as defined in the XML 1.0</em>.

     * <p>To find a <code>SchemaFactory</code> object for a given schema language,

     *     is present (where <i>schemaLanguage</i> is the parameter
     *     to this method), then its value is read
     *     as a class name. The method will try to
     *     create a new instance of this class by using the class loader,
     *     and returns it if it is successfully created.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *     <code>$java.home/lib/jaxp.properties</code> is read and
     *     the value associated with the key being the system property above
     *     is looked for. If present, the value is processed just like above.
     *   </li>
     *   <li>
     *   Use the service-provider loading facilities, defined by the
     *   {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} class, to attempt to locate and load an
     *   implementation of the service using the {@linkplain
     *   java.util.ServiceLoader#load(java.lang.Class) default loading mechanism}:
     *   the service-provider loading facility will use the {@linkplain
     *   java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() current thread's context class loader}
     *   to attempt to load the service. If the context class
     *   loader is null, the {@linkplain
     *   ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader} will be used.
     *   <br>
     *   Each potential service provider is required to implement the method
     *        {@link #isSchemaLanguageSupported(String schemaLanguage)}.
     *   <br>
     *   The first service provider found that supports the specified schema
     *   language is returned.
     *   <br>
     *   In case of {@link java.util.ServiceConfigurationError} a
     *   {@link SchemaFactoryConfigurationError} will be thrown.
     *   </li>
