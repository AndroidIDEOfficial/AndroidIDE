/**
 * Defines an abstract implementation of a factory for
 * getting XMLEventWriters and XMLStreamWriters.
 *
 * The following table defines the standard properties of this specification.
 * Each property varies in the level of support required by each implementation.
 * The level of support required is described in the 'Required' column.
 *
 *     <table border="2" rules="all" cellpadding="4">
 *     <thead>
 *      <tr>
 *        <th align="center" colspan="2">
 *          Configuration parameters
 *        </th>
 *      </tr>

 *         <tr><td>javax.xml.stream.isRepairingNamespaces</td><td>defaults prefixes on the output side</td><td>Boolean</td><td>False</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
 *      </tbody>
 *   </table>
 *
 * <p>The following paragraphs describe the namespace and prefix repair algorithm:</p>
 *
 * <p>The property can be set with the following code line:
 * <code>setProperty("javax.xml.stream.isRepairingNamespaces",new Boolean(true|false));</code></p>
 *
 * <p>This property specifies that the writer default namespace prefix declarations.
 * The default value is false. </p>
 *
 * <p>If a writer isRepairingNamespaces it will create a namespace declaration
 * on the current StartElement for
 * any attribute that does not
 * currently have a namespace declaration in scope.  If the StartElement
 * has a uri but no prefix specified a prefix will be assigned, if the prefix
 * has not been declared in a parent of the current StartElement it will be declared
 * on the current StartElement.  If the defaultNamespace is bound and in scope
 * and the default namespace matches the URI of the attribute or StartElement
 * QName no prefix will be assigned.</p>
 *
 * <p>If an element or attribute name has a prefix, but is not
 * bound to any namespace URI, then the prefix will be removed
 * during serialization.</p>
 *
 * <p>If element and/or attribute names in the same start or
 * empty-element tag are bound to different namespace URIs and
 * are using the same prefix then the element or the first
 * occurring attribute retains the original prefix and the
 * following attributes have their prefixes replaced with a
 * new prefix that is bound to the namespace URIs of those
 * attributes. </p>
 *
 * <p>If an element or attribute name uses a prefix that is
 * bound to a different URI than that inherited from the
 * namespace context of the parent of that element and there
 * is no namespace declaration in the context of the current
 * element then such a namespace declaration is added. </p>
 *
 * <p>If an element or attribute name is bound to a prefix and
 * there is a namespace declaration that binds that prefix
 * to a different URI then that namespace declaration is
 * either removed if the correct mapping is inherited from
 * the parent context of that element, or changed to the
 * namespace URI of the element or attribute using that prefix.</p>
