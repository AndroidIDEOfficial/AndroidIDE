 * <p>To provide customized error handling, implement this interface and

 * implmentation with the {@link Transformer}.  The
 * <code>Transformer</code> then reports all errors and warnings through this
 * interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>If an application does <em>not</em> register its own custom
 * <code>ErrorListener</code>, the default <code>ErrorListener</code>
 * is used which reports all warnings and errors to <code>System.err</code>
 * and does not throw any <code>Exception</code>s.
 * Applications are <em>strongly</em> encouraged to register and use
 * <code>ErrorListener</code>s that insure proper behavior for warnings and
 * errors.</p>
 *
 * <p>For transformation errors, a <code>Transformer</code> must use this
 * interface instead of throwing an <code>Exception</code>: it is up to the
 * application to decide whether to throw an <code>Exception</code> for
 * different types of errors and warnings.  Note however that the
 * <code>Transformer</code> is not required to continue with the transformation
 * after a call to {@link #fatalError(TransformerException exception)}.</p>
 *
 * <p><code>Transformer</code>s may use this mechanism to report XML parsing
 * errors as well as transformation errors.</p>
