 * <p>This class contains static methods for creating an XML reader
 * from an explicit class name, or based on runtime defaults:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *   XMLReader myReader = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();
 * } catch (SAXException e) {
 *   System.err.println(e.getMessage());
 * }

 *
 * <p><strong>Note to Distributions bundled with parsers:</strong>
 * You should modify the implementation of the no-arguments
 * <em>createXMLReader</em> to handle cases where the external
 * configuration mechanisms aren't set up.  That method should do its
 * best to return a parser when one is in the class path, even when
 * nothing bound its class name to <code>org.xml.sax.driver</code> so
 * those configuration mechanisms would see it.</p>

     * Attempt to create an XMLReader from system defaults.
     * In environments which can support it, the name of the XMLReader
     * class is determined by trying each these options in order, and
     * using the first one which succeeds:</p> <ul>
     *
     * <li>If the system property <code>org.xml.sax.driver</code>
     * has a value, that is used as an XMLReader class name. </li>
     *
     * <li>The JAR "Services API" is used to look for a class name
     * in the <em>META-INF/services/org.xml.sax.driver</em> file in
     * jarfiles available to the runtime.</li>
     *
     * <li> SAX parser distributions are strongly encouraged to provide
     * a default XMLReader class name that will take effect only when
     * previous options (on this list) are not successful.</li>
     *
     * <li>Finally, if {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.ParserFactory#makeParser()} can
     * return a system default SAX1 parser, that parser is wrapped in
     * a {@link org.xml.sax.helpers.ParserAdapter}.  (This is a migration aid for SAX1
     * environments, where the <code>org.xml.sax.parser</code> system
     * property will often be usable.) </li>

     *
     * <p> In environments such as small embedded systems, which can not
     * support that flexibility, other mechanisms to determine the default
     * may be used. </p>
     *
     * <p>Note that many Java environments allow system properties to be
     * initialized on a command line.  This means that <em>in most cases</em>
     * setting a good value for that property ensures that calls to this
     * method will succeed, except when security policies intervene.
     * This will also maximize application portability to older SAX
     * environments, with less robust implementations of this method.
