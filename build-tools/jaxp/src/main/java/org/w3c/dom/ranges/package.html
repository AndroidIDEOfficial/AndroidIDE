      Document Object Model Level 2 Traversal and Range is a 
      platform and language-neutral interfaces that allow programs 
      and scripts to dynamically traverse and identify a range of
      content in a document. The Document Object Model Level 2 
      Traversal and Range build on the Document Object Model Level 2
      Core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DOM Level 2 Traversal and Range specification is composed
      of two modules. The two modules contain specialized interfaces 
      dedicated to traversing the document structure and identifying 
      and manipulating a range in a document.

      The DOM bindings are published under the W3C Software Copyright Notice
      and License. The software license requires "Notice of any changes or
      modifications to the W3C files, including the date changes were made."
      Consequently, modified versions of the DOM bindings must document that
      they do not conform to the W3C standard; in the case of the IDL binding,
      the pragma prefix can no longer be 'w3c.org'; in the case of the Java
      binding, the package names can no longer be in the 'org.w3c' package.
