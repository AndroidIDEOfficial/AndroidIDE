 *  The <code>EventListener</code> interface is the primary method for

 * <code>EventListener</code> from its <code>EventTarget</code> after they
 * have completed using the listener.
 * <p> When a <code>Node</code> is copied using the <code>cloneNode</code>
 * method the <code>EventListener</code>s attached to the source
 * <code>Node</code> are not attached to the copied <code>Node</code>. If
 * the user wishes the same <code>EventListener</code>s to be added to the
 * newly created copy the user must add them manually.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Events-20001113'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events Specification</a>.
