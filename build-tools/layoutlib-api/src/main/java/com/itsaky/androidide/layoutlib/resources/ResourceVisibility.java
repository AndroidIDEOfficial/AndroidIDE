/**
 * An enum representing visibility of an android resource.
 *
 * <p>The below is the description of how AAPT2 understands resource visibility:
 *
 * <p>Public visibility.
 *
 * <p>A resource can be marked as public by adding the {@code public} element to a values XML file:
 *
 * <p>{@code <public name="my_public_string" type="string"/>}.
 *
 * <p>These elements are usually defined in the {@code public.xml} file inside the {@code
 * res/values} directory.
 *
 * <p>Private visibility.
 *
 * <p>Sometimes a libraries can have a great number of resources and it might be confusing or
 * tiresome to find the correct one when writing the Java or Kotlin code. In order to restrict the
 * resources visible from the source code, one can list the only resources they want to be visible
 * by using the {@code java-symbol} element:
 *
 * <p>{@code <java-symbol name="my_visible_string" type="string/>}.
 *
 * <p>These elements are usually defined in the {@code symbols.xml} file inside the {@code
 * res/values} directory. The name {@code private} comes from these resources being present in the
 * {@code private R.java} along with {@code public} resources.
 *
 * <p>Private XML only visibility.
 *
 * <p>All resources that were not marked as {@code public} or {@code private} have the {@code
 * default} visibility. They are not placed in either {@code public} nor {@code private} R classes
 * and are only accessible from other XML resources within that library/module.
 *
 * <p>Without the package for the private R.java specified, only the public R.java will be generated
 * and it will contain all resources (ones marked as public, java-symbol and those not marked as
 * either).
 *
 * <p>Additionally in the Gradle plugin we have the last enum value, {@code UNDEFINED}. It
 * represents a case where the visibility was not defined at all. This should be only used in the
 * case when we are not generating the public and private R class.
