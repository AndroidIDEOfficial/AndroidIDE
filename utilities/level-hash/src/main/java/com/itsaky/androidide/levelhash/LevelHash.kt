/**
 * Level hash is a write-optimized and high-performance hashing index scheme with cost-efficient
 * resizing and low-overhead consistency guarantee for persistent memory.
 *
 * **Level size and bucket size**
 *
 * The level size is used to determine the total capacity of the level hash,
 * while the bucket size is the number of slots in each bucket. These two
 * properties define the overall performance (load factor) of the level hash
 * (in terms of hash collisions and insertion failures). As a result, the values
 * for these properties must be chosen carefully.
 *
 * ```
 * Load factor = occupied slots / total slots
 * ```
 *
 * When the load factor of the level hash increases, the hash collisions increase
 * as well. This results in decreased access performance and insertion failures.
 * It is **recommended** to enable [AbstractLevelHashBuilder.autoExpand] which
 * will automatically expand the level hash when the load factor reaches a certain
 * threshold ([LevelHash.loadFactor]).
 *
 * @param K The key type.
 * @param V The value type.
