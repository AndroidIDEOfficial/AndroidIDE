# Build Actions

The IDE provides access to various tasks which you can execute to build your project.

## The Run tasks dialog

The `Run tasks` action shows a list of all Gradle tasks that can be executed. This feature can be used only after the project is initialized.

### How to use

After the project is initialized, click the `Run tasks` action in the options menu. The dialog will show up and load the project tasks. After the tasks has been loaded, you can click the tasks to select them.
