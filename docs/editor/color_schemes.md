# Editor Color Schemes

AndroidIDE [`v2.1.4-beta`](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/releases/tag/v2.1.4-beta) added limited support for custom color schemes in the editor. You can create your own color schemes and use it for AndroidIDE's editor. The color schemes are defined using the JSON syntax and are stored in the `$HOME/.androidide/ui/editor/schemes` directory. The default color scheme used is `AndroidIDE Default`.

Custom color schemes are currently used only for languages that use [`tree-sitter`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) for syntax highlighting.

## File structure

The color schemes stored in the schemes directory must have the following file structure : 

```
$HOME/.androidide/ui/editor/schemes
└── <scheme id> (directory)
    └── scheme.prop
```

Schemes are defined in a directory whose name is same as the id of the scheme.
For example, the `default` color scheme has the following directory structure :

```
$HOME/.androidide/ui/editor/schemes
└── default  <-- This is the scheme id
    ├── ...
    └── scheme.prop
```

### Dark variants

Dark variant of a color scheme can be defined by simply creating another color
scheme with its id suffixed with `-dark`. For example :

```
$HOME/.androidide/ui/editor/schemes
├── default  <-- 'default' color scheme
|   ├── ...
|   └── scheme.prop
|
└── default-dark  <-- Dark variant of 'default' color scheme
    ├── ...
    └── scheme.prop
```

## Scheme props

The `scheme.prop` file contains basic information about the color scheme such as the scheme name,
version, etc. This is the file that is first read by the IDE to get
information about the color scheme. The supported properties are :

```properties
# Parsed using the Java Properties parser
# <key>=<value>
# --------------------------------

# Name of the color scheme
scheme.name=<name>

# The version code of the color scheme
scheme.version=<integer>

# Whether the scheme is dark or light
scheme.isDark=<true|false>

# The JSON color scheme definition file
# This is the file which defines the color scheme
scheme.file=default.json
```

- `scheme.name` - The name of the color scheme. This is used in the color scheme selector in IDE preferences.
- `scheme.version` - The color scheme version. This is primarily used by the IDE's `ToolsManager` to check if the color schemes that are bundled with the IDE have been updated or not.
- `scheme.isDark` - Flag for light and dark color schemes.
- `scheme.file` - The JSON file which defines the color schemes.

## Color scheme definition

The JSON file that is referenced by the `scheme.prop` file with the `scheme.file` property
defines the color schemes for tokens. The structure of this file is as follows :

```json5
{
  "definitions": {
    "my_color": "#6f5a4a",
    "my_other_color": "#f9ddc9",
    ...
  },

  "editor": "@editor.json",
  
  "languages": [
    "@java.json",
    "@xml.json"
  ]
}
```

The root element of the JSON file must be a JSON object.
The root JSON object contains two JSON objects ([`definitions`](#definitions-object) and [`editor`](#editor-object))
and a JSON array ([`languages`](#languages-array)).

### Definitions object

You can define colors in the `definitions` object and then reuse these color definitions at multiple places.
Every element in the `definitions` object must be a string whose value must be a HEX color code.
For example :

```json5
{
  // Colors can be defined here
  // "key": "#hex color code"

  "definitions": {
    // we define 'my_color' here
    "my_color": "#6f5a4a",
    ...
  },

  "editor": {
    // then reference 'my_color' here
    "bg": "@my_color",

    // or here
    "line.bg": "@my_color",
    ...
  },

  "languages" : [
    {
      ...
      "styles" : {
        // as many times as we want!
        "comment": "@my_color",
      }
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Editor object

The `editor` element in the root JSON object can be a JSON object or it can be a string value
which is a reference to another JSON file. If it is a reference to another JSON file,
then the root element of that file must a JSON object. Either way, the JSON object defines
the color scheme for the editor.

For example :

```json5
{
    "definitions": { ... },

    // this is valid
    "editor": {
        "bg": "#......"
    },

    // this is also valid
    "editor": "@editor.json"
}
```

In the second case, the `editor.json` file must have the following syntax: 

```json5
{
    "bg": "#......",
    "...": "#......",

    // previously defined colors can be referred as well
    "...": "@my_color"
}
```

The keys for the editor colors can be found
[here](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/blob/83b8ffb531e96bf306734332ddea2e38441d9d54/editor/src/main/java/com/itsaky/androidide/editor/schemes/internal/parser/SchemeParser.kt#L33).

### Languages array

The `languages` JSON array contains the color schemes for the supported languages.
Similar to the [`editor`](#editor-object) object, the _elements_ of the `languages` array
can be a JSON object or a string value (reference to other JSON files). If the element in
the array is a reference to a JSON file, then that JSON file must have a JSON object as its
root element. Either way, the JSON object defines the tree-sitter metadata and styles for
tree-sitter query capture names.

For example :

```json5
{
    "definitions": { ... },
    "editor": { ... },

    "languages": [

        // You can define the language here
        {
            "types": [ "java" ],
            "styles": {  ... }
        },

        // or reference a file that defines the language
        "@java.json"
    ]
}
```

### Language object

Each JSON object (or file reference) in the `languages` array defines the properties for
specific language types. The syntax for a language object is as follows :

```json5
{
  "types": [ "cc", "cpp", ... ],
  "local.scopes": [ "scope", ... ],
  "local.scopes.members": [ "scope.members", ... ],
  "local.definitions": [ "definition.var", "definition.field", ... ],
  "local.definitions.values": [ "definition.val", ... ],
  "local.references": [ "reference", ... ],
  "styles": {
    "<capture>": {  // <capture> is the tree-sitter query capture name
      "bg": "#......",
      "fg": "@...",
      "bold": <true|false>,
      "italic": <true|false>,
      "strikethrough": <true|false>
    }
  }
}
```

- `types`                               - The type of files (file extensions) to which this color scheme can be applied. This entry is an array of string. This is helpful for languages that can have multiple file extensions. For example, a C++ source file can have `h`, `cc` or `cpp` file extension.

- `local.scopes`                        - Capture names for syntax nodes that introduce a new local variable scope.
- `local.scopes.members`                - Capture names for syntax nodes that introde a new scope for member definitions (for example, scope for fields in a class).
- `local.definition`                    - Capture names for variable declaration nodes. For example, the `identifier` in a Java variable declaration.
- `local.definition.values`             - Capture names for the value of the local variable declaration, if any. For example, the initializer in a Java variable declaration.
- `local.references`                    - Capture names for syntax nodes that are references to a local variable.
- `styles`                              - JSON object that defines the styles for the query captures. Key for each entry in this object is a tree-sitter query capture name. The value of each entry can be a string with a HEX color code (or color reference) or it can be a JSON object which defines multiple properties for rendering the text for the captured node. See example below for more information.
- `styles.<capture>.bg`            - The background color for the node.
- `styles.<capture>.fg`            - The foreground color for the node.
- `styles.<capture>.bold`          - Whether the node text must be rendered in bold letters.
- `styles.<capture>.italic`        - Whether the node text must be rendered in italic letters.
- `styles.<capture>.strikethrough` - Whether the node text must have strikethrough.


The JSON object below is a part of the Java language definition in the `default` color scheme. You can refer it for a more practical example.
