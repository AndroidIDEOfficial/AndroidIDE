## Working with an existing project

To open an existing project in AndroidIDE, click the `Open existing project` in the main activity. This opens the SAF file picker where you can choose the project directory you want to open.

Gradle based Android projects are supported. However, it is currently not possible to build projects that use older versions of the Android Gradle Plugin. To be able to build a project in AndroidIDE, your project must use Android Gradle Plugin `v7.2.0` or newer.

For people trying to build projects developed with other older IDEs, you might need to update your build scripts before opening the project in AndroidIDE.
