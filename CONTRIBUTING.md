# Contributing

This document outlines how to propose a change to AndroidIDE. By contributing to this project, you
agree to abide the terms specified in the [CODE OF CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Requirements

- Android Studio.
- JDK 11 (prefer the one bundled with Android Studio). Newer versions are not recommended.

## Build the project

Open the project in Android Studio. No extra steps are needed for this.

It is possible to build AndroidIDE in AndroidIDE iteself. But, as it might be a too heavy task for an Android device to be able to build the project, Android Studio is always recommended.

## Source code format

The source code must have `2-space` indentation (soft tab). Java source code is formatted
using `google-java-format` with `GOOGLE` style formatting.

You can
execute `./gradlew formatJavaSources` in terminal to format all Java source files using Google Java
Format.
**This will commit the changes as well**.
