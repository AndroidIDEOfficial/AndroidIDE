/**
 * A pool of reusable JavacTasks. When a task is no valid anymore, it is returned to the pool, and
 * its Context may be reused for future processing in some cases. The reuse is achieved by replacing
 * some components (most notably JavaCompiler and Log) with reusable counterparts, and by cleaning
 * up leftovers from previous compilation.
 *
 * For each combination of options, a separate task/context is created and kept, as most option
 * values are cached inside components themselves.
 *
 * When the compilation redefines sensitive classes (e.g. classes in the the java.* packages), the
 * task/context is not reused.
 *
 * When the task is reused, then packages that were already listed won't be listed again.
 *
 * Care must be taken to only return tasks that won't be used by the original caller.
 *
 * Care must also be taken when custom components are installed, as those are not cleaned when the
 * task/context is reused, and subsequent getTask may return a task based on a context with these
 * custom components.
 *
 * **This is NOT part of any supported API. If you write code that depends on this, you do so at
 * your own risk. This code and its internal interfaces are subject to change or deletion without
