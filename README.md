## Installation

> _Please install AndroidIDE from trusted sources only i.e._
> - [_The AndroidIDE website_](https://androidide.com)
> - [_GitHub Releases_](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/releases)
> - [_GitHub Actions_](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/actions)

- Download the AndroidIDE APK
  from [releases](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/releases). You
  can also download APKs
  from [GitHub actions](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/actions).
- Follow the
  instructions [here](https://androidide.com/docs/installation/) to
  install the build tools.

## Limitations

- For working with projects in AndroidIDE, your project must use Android Gradle Plugin v7.2.0 or
  newer. Projects with older AGP must be migrated to newer versions.
- SDK Manager is already included in Android SDK and is accessible in AndroidIDE via its Terminal.
  But, you cannot use it to install some tools (like NDK) because those tools are not built for
  Android.
- No official NDK support because we haven't built the NDK for Android.

The app is still being developed actively. It's in beta stage and may not be stable. if you have any
issues using the app, please let us know.
